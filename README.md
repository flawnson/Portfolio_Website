# Website

This repository contains the code for my website and blog as hosted on CPanel.

## Hosting
Domains are managed on GoDaddy (.com and .ca are each on separate accounts).
Web hosting is managed by CPanel. You can access the CPanel admin by following the steps [here](https://ca.godaddy.com/help/access-cpanel-in-my-linux-hosting-40972).
You'll need to log into CPanel, pull the most recent changes, and deploy HEAD after making changes for them to appear on the production site.

## Libraries and Packages

The main dependencies are Bootstrap 3 (I didn't use 4 because my previous website used 3), fontawesome (and it's cousin, Academicicons), and fonts (Raleway, Roboto, and Karla) supplied by Google's CDN. Everything else is coded from scratch. The home page has a link to my blog.

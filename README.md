# Website

This repository contains the code for my website and blog as hosted on CPanel.

## Libraries and Packages

The main dependencies are Bootstrap 3 (I didn't use 4 because my previous website used 3), fontawesome (and it's cousin, Academicicons), and fonts (Raleway, Roboto, and Karla) supplied by Google's CDN. Everything else is coded from scratch. The home page has a link to my blog.

# Blog

Attempts to use Notion as a CMS aren't going as planned, but I still like writing in Notion, so I plan to make use of the export to HTML or MD function a lot. For scientific writing I use LaTeX. When I need to convert between files I use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). I will wait patiently for the Notion API ðŸ¥±
